# Phase 5 Financial Independence Score Model

## Objective
Record the status of scoring for `Independencia financiera` in the financial guide.

## Current status
1. Phase 5 exists in the guide as a product phase.
2. Its title is `Independencia financiera`.
3. Its objective is to build asset income that can cover the target lifestyle.

## Implementation status
1. There is currently no dedicated runtime diagnostic score for phase 5 equivalent to phases 1 to 4.
2. The shared guide diagnostics currently expose:
   - `phase1GlobalScore`
   - `phase2GlobalScore`
   - `phase3GlobalScore`
   - `phase4GlobalScore`
3. The phase detail view treats only phases 1 to 4 as diagnostic phases.
4. Phase 5 is present in navigation and roadmap language, but not yet as an implemented scoring model.

## Practical implication
1. There is no canonical `phase5GlobalScore` in the current runtime logic.
2. There are no phase-5 score cards equivalent to the implemented score-card sets for phases 1 to 4.
3. Any future document for phase 5 should be updated only once the scoring logic is defined in code.

## Recommended future direction
When phase 5 scoring is implemented, this document should capture:

1. productive-asset income coverage
2. recurring passive-income ratio
3. dependency on active income
4. stability and diversification of productive assets
5. final phase-5 global score and tone mapping
